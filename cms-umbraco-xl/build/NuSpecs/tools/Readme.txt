A note about running Umbraco from Visual Studio.

Don't forget to build!

BETA Notice: We've done our best to transform your config files, we are testing this in 7.2 beta and would love to 
hear back if it didn't work so we can improve this feature. We'd love to see your before and after config files 
(make sure to delete sensitive data like passwords and API keys) in the issue tracker at http://issues.umbraco.org/
Remember, we backed up your files in App_Data\NuGetBackup so you can find the original file before it was transformed.

When upgrading your website using NuGet you should answer "No" to the questions to overwrite the Web.config 
file (and config files in the config folder). 

We've overwritten all the files in the Umbraco and Umbraco_Client folder, these have been backed up in 
App_Data\NuGetBackup. We didn't overwrite the UI.xml file nor did we remove any files or folders that you or a package
might have added. Only the existing files were overwritten. If you customized anything then make sure to do a compare 
and merge with the NuGetBackup folder.

This nuget package includes build targets that extends the creation of a deploy package, which is generated by 
Publishing from Visual Studio. The targets will only work once Publishing is configured, so if you don't use
Publish this won't affect you.
These things will now be automatically included when creating a deploy package or publishing to the file system:
umbraco, umbraco_client, config\splashes and global.asax.
